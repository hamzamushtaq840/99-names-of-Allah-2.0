          The 99 names of Allah (known as Asma ul Husna) serve as a mosaic of
          His infinite attributes, each one reflecting a unique quality of the
          Creator that resonates with the human experience. These names are not
          just titles; they are descriptors of Allah&apos;s actions in the world
          and His relationship with creation. In the Quran, Allah introduces
          Himself through these names, laying a foundation for love and
          understanding.
