      Allah calls Himself Ar-Rahman. Rahman is derived from the root "ر-ح-م" (r-h-m),
      which is related to mercy and compassion. In Arabic, Rahman takes the form of "faʿlan,"
      which is an ism sifa (a descriptive noun), that conveys an intense or overwhelming quality
      itself being, in this case being merciful. It implies that He is merciful at all times and
      in all situations, not just in specific instances.It highlights the nature. For Allah, this
      term signifies mercy to the utmost degree that has no limits or bounds.

    </br>
    <p>
      <b className='text-white'>Ar-Rahman</b> never appears in the Quran followed by 'with them' or
      'to them' because it means that “mercy” is Allah's inherent attribute. This mercy is shown through
      His boundless compassion and kindness: the lush green plants 🍃 and trees 🌳, the simple joys of home
      life, the breath of life in our lungs, and the rain 🌧️ that nourishes the earth. Ar-Rahman reflects 
      Allah's steady and all-encompassing mercy to all creation.
