    intro: `Allah calls himself Ar-Rahman. First, let's look at what Rahman means. 
            Rahman means "gracious," "King," "merciful," or "Lord." For Allah, this 
            term signifies His vast and full mercy. In Arabic, this word-form shows 
            vastness and completeness.<br><br>'Ar-Rahman' never appears in the Quran followed
            by 'with them/to them' because it means that “mercy” is Allah’s inherent 
            attribute. This mercy is shown through His boundless compassion and 
            kindness—the lush green plants and trees, the simple joys of home life, the 
            breath of life in our lungs, and the rain that nourishes the earth. Ar-Rahman 
            reflects Allah’s steady and all-encompassing mercy to all creation.<br><br>The name 
            Ar-Rahman (The Merciful) is mentioned in the Quran exactly twice as many times 
            (114 times) as the name Al-Aziz (The Almighty) (57 times). This shows that Allah 
            is the greatest creator, alone, with none like Him. All creations are different 
            and completely under His authority. The mountains, the heavens, and the earth 
            all bow in awe and worship of Ar-Rahman. <br><br>Allah’s mercy to disbelievers is only 
            for this world. In the afterlife, when they ask Allah to remove them from Hellfire 
            and seek His help, they will admit their wrongdoing, showing that His mercy 
            was truly not with them in the end.`,

She is asking for protection from the Most Powerful, the Almighty, not mercy from "the Beneficent"! (see editor's note 3). She is asking for protection from Al-Rahman against the "intruder" in order also to frighten the "intruder", for which situation the appellation "the Merciful" or "The Most Gracious" would hardly instill fear, and hence be unsuitable. Obviously, Maryam knew the meaning of the name Al-Rahman and we are shown here by Al-Rahman himself (who, according to 55:2, teaches us the Quran) that she used His name appropriately.`,

Abraham chose the name Al-Rahman knowing that great punishment is more appropriate to scare his father when associated to an Almighty rather a Most Merciful. This again sheds great light on the true meaning of the name Al-Rahman. It is within the bounds of the Almighty, His authority and power to afflict punishment, but it is not within the definition of "mercy" or "beneficence" or "graciousness" to afflict punishment or cause torture.`,
