    <p>
     Allah calls Himself Ar-Rahman. Rahman is derived from the root "ر-ح-م" (r-h-m), which is related to mercy and compassion. In Arabic, Rahman takes the form of "faʿlan," which is an ism sifa (a descriptive noun), that conveys an intense or overwhelming quality itself being, in this case being merciful. It implies that He is merciful at all times and in all situations, not just in specific instances.It highlights the nature. For Allah, this term signifies mercy to the utmost degree that has no limits or bounds.   
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
     <b className='text-white'>Ar-Rahman</b> never appears in the Quran followed by 'with them' or 'to them' because it means that “mercy” is Allah's inherent attribute. This mercy is shown through His boundless compassion and kindness: the lush green plants 🍃 and trees 🌳, the simple joys of home life, the breath of life in our lungs, and the rain 🌧️ that nourishes the earth. Ar-Rahman reflects Allah's steady and all-encompassing mercy to all creation.

She is asking for protection from Al-Rahman against the "intruder" in order also to frighten the "intruder", for which situation the appellation "the Merciful" or "The Most Gracious" would hardly instill fear, and hence be unsuitable.

Abraham chose the name Al-Rahman knowing that great punishment is more appropriate to scare his father when associated to an Almighty rather a Most Merciful. This again sheds great light on the true meaning of the name Al-Rahman. It is within the bounds of the Almighty, His authority and power to afflict punishment, but it is not within the definition of "mercy" or "beneficence" or "graciousness" to afflict punishment or cause torture.`,

In His Hand is the dominion over all things: life, death, resurrection, the Hereafter, and everything you can imagine. The skies, the beautiful stars, the universe—everything we know and everything we don't know—He is the one and only King of it all. Everything you have belongs to Allah, so don't take pride in it.

     Allah is in need of nothing and of nobody. Yet, everybody and everything are in need of Him. He is the true Owner, and we should acknowledge that everything we have is just a mercy from Him through His kingdom. We own nothing; it all comes from Him The prophet (SAW) was reported as saying: "On the day of Judgment Allah will seize the earth and fold the sky in His right hand. Then He will say 'I am the King. Where are the kings of the earth.'

    intro: `
    <p>
     Allah calls Himself Al-Mu'min. Mu'min is derived from the root letters hamza-meem-noon (أ م ن), which convey four core meanings: to be safe, secure, and without fear; to be calm and peaceful; to protect and safeguard; and to be trustworthy and to believe. He is the One who grants faith (eemaan) and peace, filling our hearts with faith and being the most trustworthy in the universe 🕊️.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p> 
     When Allah reveals His name Al-Mu'min in His servant, He fills the heart ❤️ with a sense of security, shielding it from fears and anxieties. If this blessing were withdrawn even for a moment, life would feel unbearable, like living in chaos. The feeling of safety is a precious gift and a reflection of Allah's name, Al-Mu'min. The effects of this name extend beyond humans, allowing us to live in peace, and also in animals, who find security through it. For example, birds do not know in the morning what they will eat or hunt, yet they are provided for. We express our gratitude to our Lord, Al-Mu'min, who eases our hearts from fear and anxiety and continually enriches us with this vast blessing.
