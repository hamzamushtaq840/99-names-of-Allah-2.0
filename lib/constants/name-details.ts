      <b className='text-white'>Ar-Rahman</b> never appears in the Quran followed by 'with them' or 'to them' because it means that “mercy” is Allah's inherent attribute. This mercy is shown through His boundless compassion and kindness: the lush green plants 🍃 and trees 🌳, the simple joys of home life, the breath of life in our lungs, and the rain 🌧️ that nourishes the earth. Ar-Rahman reflects Allah's steady and all-encompassing mercy to all creation.
