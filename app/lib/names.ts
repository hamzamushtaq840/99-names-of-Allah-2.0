      Allah calls Himself Ar-Rahman. Rahman is derived from the root "ر-ح-م" (r-h-m),
      which is related to mercy and compassion. In Arabic, Rahman takes the form of "faʿlan," which is an ism sifa (a descriptive noun), that conveys an intense or overwhelming quality itself being, in this case being merciful. It implies that He is merciful at all times and in all situations, not just in specific instances.It highlights the nature. For Allah, this term signifies mercy to the utmost degree that has no limits or bounds.

    <p>
      <b className='text-white'>Ar-Rahman</b> never appears in the Quran followed by 'with them' or 'to them' because it means that “mercy” is Allah's inherent attribute. This mercy is shown through His boundless compassion and kindness: the lush green plants 🍃 and trees 🌳, the simple joys of home life, the breath of life in our lungs, and the rain 🌧️ that nourishes the earth. Ar-Rahman reflects Allah's steady and all-encompassing mercy to all creation.

    Allah calls Himself Al-Malik. The word "Malik" in Arabic means "King." Allah owns the universe and controls it. In His Hand is the dominion over all things: life, death, resurrection, the Hereafter, and everything you can imagine. The skies, the beautiful stars, the universe—everything we know and everything we don't know—He is the one and only King of it all. Everything you have belongs to Allah, so don't take pride in it.

     Allah is in need of nothing and of nobody. Yet, everybody and everything are in need of Him. He is the true Owner, and we should acknowledge that everything we have is just a mercy from Him through His kingdom. We own nothing; it all comes from Him The prophet (SAW) was reported as saying: "On the day of Judgment Allah will seize the earth and fold the sky in His right hand. Then He will say 'I am the King. Where are the kings of the earth.'
